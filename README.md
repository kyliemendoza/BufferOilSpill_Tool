# Final GIS4102C
Oil spills pose significant environmental threats, disrupting ecosystems and endangering
wildlife. For agencies like the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC)
tasked with safeguarding our environment, conducting risk assessments is crucial. By assessing
potential oil spill risks, they gain insight into planning and reserving funds for emergency
disasters that can profoundly impact our ecosystem. Our state heavily relies on its ecosystem for
tourism and functionality, making it imperative to identify high-risk areas and prioritize
mitigation efforts.

# Objective: 
Creating a Python script tool in ArcGIS ArcToolbox that automates the identification of potential
oil spill risk locations based on environmental sensitivity and proximity to critical habitats using
FWC GIS data.
